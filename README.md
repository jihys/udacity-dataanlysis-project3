# udacity-data-anlysis-project3


In this project, I will wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. Since the Twitter archive only contains very basic tweet information, I will additionaly gather data using Tweeter API and combine with the WeRateDogs Twitter data. The combined data will be also assessed and cleaned to get insightful analyses and visualizations.

## Data
### WeRateDog Twitter Archive
The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).

### Additional Data via the Twitter API
Retweet count and favorite count are very important information but these values are omitted. So I will gather these information through Twitter's API for all 5000+ tweet IDs within the enhanced tweetter archive file.

### Twitter Image Predictions File
This file contains the dog breed classification results from a Nuerual Network model for every images in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This file has a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images)
